## The Project

### What problem are you trying to solve?

Our mission is to build the future infrastructure of the sharing economy by enabling anyone to rent, sell or share anything - without middlemen.

Slock.it:

- makes it possible to trust the other party without an intermediary
- handles secure direct payments
- provides a mechanism of deposits, and later, full blown insurance
- solves the issue of needing to be physically present to hand over keys
- helps both owners and renters finding each other
- is universal supporting varied objects including cars, lockers, apartments, sheds, office space, etc.

If it can be locked, it can be Slocked!

For a good introduction to our vision, please see Christoph Jentzsch [introductory blog post](https://blog.Slock.it/Slock-it-blog/Slock-it-decentralizing-the-emerging-sharing-economy-cf19ce09b957#.4j2mtca7t).

### What is Slock.it potential market?

Anywhere where there are underused assets such as parked cars, parking slots or temporarily vacant apartments.
Our solution enables both consumers and businesses to turn assets into income. 
Almost anything can be retrofitted with a Slock: homes, offices, power tools, bicycles, household electronics, cars, motorcycles and of course lockers.

The sharing economy has created [17](http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/04/the-sharing-economy-has-created-17-billion-dollar-companies-and-10-unicorns/) billion-dollar companies with 60,000 employees.
The sector has received north of $15 billion in funding so far and its global yearly revenue is projected
to reach $335 billion by 2025 (source: [PWC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/publications/assets/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-the-sharing-economy.pdf)).

We believe that very soon, cars will be available in the street for rent, Airbnbs will be fully automated, and entrepreneurs will 
prefer to rent private work spaces on demand rather than commit to complex leases. 
Owners in a share economy become both consumer and producer, leveraging Slocks to earn an income without losing revenue to any third party.

We're slowly but surely reaching a point where the millennials' philosophy is becoming "If you can rent it, why own it". 
66% of the world is willing to share or rent their personal assets for financial gain, and that figure is as high as 
[94%](http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/nielsenglobal/apac/docs/reports/2014/Nielsen-Global-Share-Community-Report.pdf) in China. 
We believe Slock.it is uniquely placed to address those needs, today.

### Who are Slock.it potential partners?

We are currently reaching out to a number of partners, in particular:

- Sharing economy insurance providers
- Manufacturers of smart locks for the home and offices
- Manufacturers of electronic bike locks
- Real estate companies investing in smart homes
- Hotels and BnBs

### Is Slock.it open source?

Should Slock.it GmbH be selected as the DAO service provider, our vision is for all the code, the smart contracts, user interfaces, mobile apps, 
the DAO itself, that is, everything forming the Slock.it DAO to be free, libre and Open Source, for anyone to use and reuse, 
meaning we'll not only make these things public, we'll also do everything in our power to see companies other than us develop Slock.it framework compatible products.

### What's in it for Slock.it GmbH then?

Slock.it GmbH will put up a proposal to become the DAO's service provider at the end of the token presale. 
Slock.it GmbH is a for profit company, and the DAO is one of its clients. Parallel to its open source engagement with the DAO, Slock.it GmbH will also be consulting and developing unrelated, closed source products for its other private clients.

### Can I help with anything?

Yes, it's an open source project and everyone is encouraged to participate in any way they can. We're currently 
trialling a volunteer program for community organizers. 

Things we could use help with include:

- Reviewing and contributing code on [github](https://github.com/Slockit/) (it's an open source project after all!)
- Analysing the market in different parts of the world
- Translating the site, the whitepaper, the videos and the apps
- Operating local forums (especially in non-roman character sets)
- Later on, testing prototype hardware

## How it works

### How do Slocks work?

Slocks will come in many shapes and sizes. The owner of a Slock sets a deposit amount and a price for using one ore more items.
 A user can then makes a payment on the Ethereum blockchain, thereby gaining permission to open or close that Slock through a mobile app.

The deposit is held as collateral in a smart contract until the user returns the item. 
Smart contracts are automatically enforced, with the deposit returned to the user minus the cost of the rental, 
which in turn will be automatically disbursed to the owner of the Slock.

All of this happens without any assistance from a third-party.


### Will users have to pay everytime they use a Slock?

Unlike in Philip K Dick's "[Ubik](https://twitter.com/aprilaser/status/564811861024329729)", 
they won't have to. Only renting access to the lock costs money. 
Any current user (which could also include the owner) sends [Whisper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper-Overview) signed messages 
(which do not cost anything) to open or close the door.

### Who earns from the usage of the Slocks?

The DAO Token owners will benefit from the Slock fees. The Slock usage fees represent the cost of decentralization 
and will be determined by the DAO itself when it engages with the service provider.

### What if users want to own a Slock outright?

It's possible, by paying a one-time deployment fee to the DAO. This will remove the per-use fee. 
Note that the amount in question will be determined by the DAO itself when it engages with the service provider.

### Will users be able to use a debit or credit card to open a Slock?

We'd very much like that. We're currently approaching various financial institutions to try and make this a reality.

### Aren't the Slocks going to get vandalized?

Of course some will, as Slocks aren't a panacea for theft or damage. What Slocks can do that traditional locks cannot, 
is provide an insurance option 'baked' into the usage contract. A crude example would be setting a deposit, 
which in the case of items that are too cumbersome to transport - or are of a low enough value - might work quite well. 
A more complex implementation could include a link to a sharing economy insurance contract, something we are currently working on with partners.

### What happens if there no power or Internet?

The same thing that would happen if any other smart lock was employed: some will 'fail secure' while others will 'fail safe'.
Which mode of operation is used is not determined by the Slock DAO, but instead by the use case and local regulation. For example, 
fire rated and hotel room doors will probably 'fail safe' while a locker will certainly 'fail secure').



## The Product

### What exactly is the "Ethereum Computer"?

A tiny, preinstalled, preconfigured home server running both an optimized Ethereum node and a series of decentralised application: 
a web3 identity vault, a Slock gateway to your IoT, and even some experimental software including an IPFS server that could earn you a few ethers.

In short, it's little box that manages your permissions and identity, with strong encryption and permission control. 
It's a secure gatekeeper between the web & web3 to your home IoT, communicating with your smart objects via zigbee or zwave. 
It's also a brilliant development platform, packaging all the software that's needed as part of an optimized image.

### What are some good use cases for the Ethereum Computer?

- Never have to trust 3rd party servers with your keys or smart contract execution: web servers should only serve static Dapp assets, not act as middlemen relaying queries to the blockchain
- Enable your entire home to communicate with the blockchain: rent your flat or share any Slock.it enabled smart object directly and securely. 
- Run an IFPS node and perhaps even get rewarded for offering storage space to the network
- Develop applications with Ethereum and never have to worry about installation difficulties, updates or compatibility issues between the various modules of the Ethereum 'framework' (Whisper, EVM, Web3.js, Swarm, etc). We will push updates only when we have tested the current stack top to bottom
- Help secure the network and get rewarded for it (once Ethereum has switched to PoS), without having to dedicate larger, more expensive and less secure equipment to that task

### Will it be hackable/open?

Absolutely. We'll make the devkit images publicly available, but also all of the detailed code that went into building the 'stack' 
so you can modify/improve on the installation itself. One thing we're aiming to do is using a board/SoC combination that is publicly 
available so that one could completely rebuild the Ethereum Computer from scratch if they wanted to. Having some GPIO available 
would also allow anyone to connect wired objects to the Ethereum network: we want you to be able to experiment!

### When will the Ethereum Computer become available for sale?

Late 2017, although we anticipate devkits much earlier as part of an iterative development process.

### Will it be useful for mining?

The Ethereum Computer is a full Ethereum client and therefore perfectly capable to have its mining function enabled. 
That said, it would not be a good platform to mine on while Ethereum is still using proof of work, as its form factor prevents 
it from having the crunching power GPUs have. The Ethereum Computer will be a perfectly appropriate platform to help secure the network once Ethereum switches to proof of stake.


## The Presale

### Why do a Slock token presale?

We could have done a kickstarter to bootstrap the Slock.it project, but just like we don't believe Airbnb taking 15% of all transactions 
is a fair model, we didn't feel it would make any sense to hand out 5% to the Kickstarter corporation when Ethereum allow us to decentralize this process.

So instead, we're using the blockchain to organize a presale where people pledge to support building the Slock.it sharing community, 
and in exchange receive a reward in the form of Slock tokens that can be used with any Slocks.

Once the project is launched, anyone not owning these tokens will have to pay a fee to the Slocks in order to use them. 
A portion of the fees will go back to all the Slock token holders to continue growing his sharing community and creating a healthy virtuous circle.

In order to keep that process fair and decentralized even after the presale, a DAO will be created to so that the funds 
held by the sharing community will never be centraly managed. Slock tokens holders will be able to vote on important 
decisions relating to the management of the DAO.

### What are Slock tokens?

Slock tokens allows the holders to vote on important issues in the Slock DAO proportionally to how many tokens they hold, 
and also give them access to a portion of the revenue generated by Slocks.

### When is the Slock token presale?

It will take place at the beginning of 2016.

### How long will it last?

Roughly two months.

### Can I mine Slock tokens?

No. Slock tokens are used purely to represent the proportion of votes and rewards a Slock token holder is entitled to as part of the DAO. 
If you would like to mine something, try [ether](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Mining).

### Will I be able to send, receive and exchange Slock tokens?

Yes, there will be functions build in the smart contract to send/receive Slock tokens however, 
these will not be activated until the project launches in earnest in 2017.

### Will I need to be technical to purchase tokens?

No, the purchase process will be done entirely online via a website. If you already have an ether wallet,
 you'll be able to use that, or the site will just generate one on the fly for you.
 
### Will anyone hold 'premined' tokens?

No. We are morally opposed to premines, and deem them unfair and an obstacle to true innovation. 
There won't be any 'early contributor pool' either, or anything of the sort. The only tokens in circulation 
will be the ones purchased during the Slock token presale, that's it.

### Will there be another opportunity to purchase tokens?

There will be only one Slock token presale. Once launched during the course of 2017, 
the Slock DAO will be fully autonomous and decentralized. How it then manages itself, including decisions on its finances, 
is entirely up to 'it'. Slock token holders will hold voting rights, be able to submit proposals, and pass motions.

### How will the DAO control the funds it receives during the presale?

The Slock token holders will elect the service provider of their choosing, and the conditions under which funds are distributed. 
These decisions are entirely governed by smart contracts, and accessible through a simple online interface.

### Is there a minimum goal for the presale?

Yes. A minimum of 700.000 ether equivalent in any crypto token is sought in order to be able to build a meaningful DAO and first product. 
If the minimum is not reached, participants in the presale will be able to request their funds back (denominated in ether).

### Will the presale accept Bitcoin, Doge, etc.?

Yes, we have partnered with Shapeshift so that the Slock token presale will accept not only Bitcoin, but most crypto tokens in existence, 
including Litecoin, Doge, Maidsafe, StorjcoinX, Bitshares, BitUSD, Nxt, Dash, Clams and many, many others.

### Will the Slock token presale accept FIAT currencies?

Not directly. In order to take part, you must use a crypto currency. To exchange FIAT for Crypto currencies you should use an exchange such as [Kraken](https://kraken.com).



## The DAO

### DA.. what?

DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a form of company which operates entirely on the blockchain. 
Slock token holders can review proposals and cast their votes to elect a service provider which will represents 
them in the physical world,. This process is very similar to selecting a software or hardware supplier. 
A DAO is however superior in many respect to a traditional company in the sense that all the decisions it takes are transparent, 
its finances can be audited by anyone and corruption is made impossible.

### Is this just for geeks?

Definitely not. In order to make decisions, token holders will be able to vote using a straightforward interface using Mist, 
the Ethereum browser. You'll have to be able to install software on your machine, and use what essentially looks and feel like a website. 
That's it.

### What can the DAO do exactly?

The DAO can choose a service provider to implement a technology or develop a product, either by sending funds directly or signing a smart contract. 
The smart contract specifies the terms of the relationship between the DAO and its service provider.

Once a provider has been selected, the DAO can call functions on the service provider smart contract, setting the values of operating parameters which could include, 
for example, how much of a usage fee is taken from each Slock and returned to the Slock token holders.

What parameters are available depend on the service provider and could range from a 'hands off' approach to having the DAO hold complete operational control.

### Who can submit proposals to vote on?

Any Slock token holder.

### How often can the DAO vote on proposals?

As often as it wishes to.

### How can the DAO protect its funds from ether's volatility?

The Slock DAO can enter into a hedging contract to protect its funds from ether's volatility. This contract could be provided by a third party. 
Slock.it GmbH intends to submit a proposal on hedging to the DAO at the end of the presale.

### Why doesn't Slock.it GmbH raise money through a presale instead?

Because we believe DAOs are the future of how business are structured. A DAO will provide much greater security and transparency than a 
traditional presale as investors will stay in control of the funds even after the presale has ended. DAOs also bring about open governance 
by allowing any Slock token holder to vote on all major business decisions.

*Note: the following section of the FAQ is technical and covers advanced topics that originate from Vitalik Buterin's blog post on [The Subjectivity / Exploitability Tradeoff](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/02/14/subjectivity).*

### What's a 51% attack, and how do you prevent it?

If someone was to acquire 51% of the Slock tokens, they could vote themselves as the service provider, and then send 100% of the funds to their own account. 
In order to prevent this, the Slock DAO is able to split itself proportionally to the vote results, leaving the attacker with his money and the rest of the 
participants with their own. Because of this mechanism, there is no incentive to run such an attack, since it is not only unprofitable, but the attacker 
would also be stuck with worthless Slock Tokens from his own fork of the DAO.

### Why is there only a single service provider at any given time?

For safety reasons. In order to prevent a 51% attack, we needed to introduce the rule that the DAO may split up in case there is no mutual 
agreement on a selecting a service provider, which in turn removes any incentive to even attempt to bring about such an attack. 
Having room for more than a single service provider would negate this failsafe.

### How often can the DAO change service provider?

At anytime.

### What is the process for selecting a new service provider?

This takes place in two steps. The first step is a simple majority vote on keeping the existing service provider or choosing a new one. The second step is a confirmation vote, 
where the minority, having lost the previous vote but comfortable the winner is in fact not an attacker, 
can vote alongside the majority in order to avoid splitting the DAO. On the other hand, if the minority does suspects a 51% attack, 
it's important for it to keep its ability stick with its decision to split the DAO, effectively rendering any attack unprofitable.
